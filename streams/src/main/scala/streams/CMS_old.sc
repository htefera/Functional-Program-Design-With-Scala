//Nothing prevents just passing the empty set of viewers to a query.
/** When asking a query, we have to pass a Viewers set to the conference
management methods.
But Viewers is an unknown abstract type; hence there is no way to create
a Viewers instance outside the ConfManagement object.
So the only way to get a viewers value is in the parameter of a query,
where the conference management system provides the actual value.
 the following question generates an error*/

/**
 * Back to the conference management code:
 * One downside is that we have to pass viewers arguments along
 * everywhere they are needed.
 * This seems pointless, since by design there is only a single value we could pass!
 * It also quickly gets tedious as the codebase grows.
 * Canâ€™t this be automated?
 * Of course: Just use implicit parameters.
