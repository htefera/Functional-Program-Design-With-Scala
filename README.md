  The course is given by Coursera and EPFL University [Go to the course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/scala-functional-program-design?)


### Course Objectives

* Recognize and apply design principles of functional programs
* Design functional libraries and their API
* Understand reasoning techniques for programs that combine functions and state
* In-depth understading of Lazy evaulation, Scala Type Class, functional Programming, referential transparency and reactive programming
* Understand Reactive programming and write simple functional reactive applications


### Tools, Technologies and Languages
* **Language**-Scala, JavaScript
* **Scala to JavaScript compiler**- Scala.js
* **Editor or IDE**-IntelliJ
* **Build tool**-sbt

### Course organization

<br>

[Week 4]()<br>

* Understandings of functions and state 
* Program side-effects
* Appication of functions and states on a discrete event simulation
* Advanced loop expressions
<br>

[Week 5]()<br>

* Scala event handling
* Imperative event handling using the observer patter
* Functional reactive programming(FRP)
* Implementation of simple bank system using FRP

### Program Execution
1. Import as sbt project into IntelliJ
2. Run the project either as main program or using sbt
 Running the program using SBR
 1. First start sbt in the project root directory
 2. Inside the sbt console 
      * Compile the program using the **compile** command
      * Test the program using the **test** command
      * Run the program using the **run** command
